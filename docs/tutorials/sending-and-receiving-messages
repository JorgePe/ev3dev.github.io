title: Sending and receiving messages with MQTT
subject: Networking

«MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922)
publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the
TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a
"small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited.»

It's very easy to use the MQTT protocol to exchange small messages between several
devices.

We need a broker that can be running outside the EV3 (like a laptop or a Raspberry
Pi) but for light usages can also run on the EV3:

    sudo apt-get install mosquitto

This installs and then starts the mosquitto daemon, you can check with

    robot@ev3dev:~# service mosquitto status
    ● mosquitto.service - LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker
       Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/mosquitto)
       Active: active (running) since Wed 2016-05-11 07:40:51 WEST; 7min ago
       CGroup: /system.slice/mosquitto.service
               └─685 /usr/sbin/mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
           
Now we are able to send and receive messages through the broker (by default
mosquitto uses port 1883). We just need to install a python library:

    sudo easy_install paho-mqtt

Now a very simple script to test sending messages ("publishing"):

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

    # This is the Publisher
    
    client = mqtt.Client()
    client.connect("localhost",1883,60)
    client.publish("topic/test", "Hello world!");
    client.disconnect();

Note: if using an external broker (i.e. not the mosquitto deamon running in the
EV3) replace "localhost" with the IP address of the device that hosts the broker.

Any MQTT client that is connected to our broker and has subscribed for "topic/test"
will receive a MQTT message with "Hello world!" as the payload. We can test it with
a mobile phone (there are several free MQTT client apps available) but we can also
test it on our PC or on another EV3:

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

    # This is the Subscriber
    
    def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
      print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))
      client.subscribe("topic/test")

    def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
      if (msg.payload == "Hello world!"):
        print("Yes!")
        client.disconnect()
        
    client = mqtt.Client()
    client.connect("THE_IP_ADDRESS_OF_OUR_BROKER",1883,60)

    client.on_connect = on_connect
    client.on_message = on_message

    client.loop_forever()

Note: the second EV3 (the "Subscriber") just needs the "paho-mqtt" library,
there is no need to install the "mosquitto" daemon.

This is just a very basic example - one Publisher and one Subscriber, but it
is very easy to extend (and don't forget that the same device can play both
roles).

Since we can connect several clients to the same broker we can also send
messages to the EV3 "Subscriber" not just from the EV3 "Publisher" but also
from anything that can publish MQTT messages, like a PC, a mobile phone, a
Raspberry Pi or an Arduino. Welcome to the Internet of Things!

One interesting possibility is running "node-red" on our PC as it offers two
built-in MQTT nodes ("mqtt in" and "mqtt out"). With just a few clicks we can
create a flow that connects our EV3's to the internet.

A more advanced example is being prepared.
