LEGO officially suports the NETGEAR N150 Wireless Adapter (WNA1100)
with the native EV3 firmware. Of course, it also works with ev3dev.
But ev3dev supports many other Wi-Fi adapters - if your Wi-Fi
USB dongle works in your Linux system there is a good chance it
will also works with ev3dev.

This is a list of other known Wi-Fi USB devices that also work with
ev3dev. Even if your device is not in this list it may use the same
chipset, so you should use lsub and dmesg commands to proper identify
it after you connect it to your system:
